Some users believe it's funny to have statuses like the one below: \
![This user is suspected of being part of an online cultist organization. Please report any suspicious activity to Discord staff](/suspicious-status.png) \
These statuses are **not real**. Discord will **never** add a warning on someone's profile, they will simply ban the user.
